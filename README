MudCore, a simple MUD server
============================

MudCore is a simple MUD server. Game logic is implemented in lua,
telnet handling is done for you, and the server can communicate with
the outside world by way of ZeroMQ sockets.

Build dependencies:
-------------------
- GLib (debian: libglib2.0-dev)
- libtelnet (build source from https://github.com/elanthis/libtelnet)
- lua 5.2 (debian: liblua5.2-dev)
- pkg-config (debian: pkg-config)
- ZeroMQ >= 2.1 (debian: libzmq-dev)

Additional dependencies to build documentation:
-----------------------------------------------
- texinfo (debian: apt-get install texinfo)
- texlive (pdf/ps/dvi only, debian: apt-get install texlive)

If you want documentation in a form that's not .info, try running
`make pdf' or `make html'. Similarly, `make install-pdf' or `make
install-html' will do what you expect.

Additional dependencies to build from git:
------------------------------------------
- autoconf (debian: apt-get install autoconf)
- automake (debian: apt-get install automake)

Building from source is the usual `./configure && make && make
install' dance, but you'll need to run `autoreconf -i' first if you're
building from git. The server runs just fine without being installed
by `make install', if you don't want to install it.
